<h1>Eyewitness Puzzle</h1>
<!--This is my text-->
<h2>You've made it! The room is quite bizarre compared to the last... it has old furniture scattered all around. You think surely something will be inside of the furniture that will open this next door, but you're wrong. You check each and every drawer and every crack for some sort of hint but the dressers and shelves are empty... you're sure of it. You and your team are stumped! After some time, you think "maybe a clue isn't inside, maybe it's around!" so you begin the search again! Sure enough, tucked between the wall and the old greek dresser is a  journal. The pages are covered in tiny handwriting and stories of who you believe to be a young girl named Thea. You begin reading and are in awe of the things that she mentions- Gods, demigods, gold-plated streets, horse-drawn chariots. It seemed like this young girl had lived in the perfect utopian society. You pause for a second... this has to be Atlantis! Your brain starts spinning and making connections, after all, Atlantis had always been described as the perfect utopian society! Your excitement begins to boil over, but your teammates remind you- there is no way to know for sure if you've found the lost city unless you find Poseidon's trident. You had to keep working to get through this door or you might never know if this place is what you think it is. So you keep reading. Two particular pages stand out...</h2>

<h2>The next pages of the journal were blank, and the dates aligned with the disappearance of the lost city. What disaster do you think Thea and the other citizens of Atlantis experienced on this last day of the lost city's existence?</h2>
